(** A logged-in client's outbound event channel.

    One [Session.t] is created per logged-in connection. It holds the
    participant identity established at login plus a pipe that the
    [Dispatcher] writes to whenever a matching-engine event involving this
    participant is produced ([Order_accept], [Order_cancel], [Order_reject],
    [Fill] as aggressor or resting party).

    The reader half is handed back to the client via [session_feed_rpc]; the
    client drains it asynchronously. *)

(** [participant_id] is the interned id the registry minted for [participant]
    at login. The session carries both so hot paths that already hold a
    session (submit/cancel handlers, dispatch) never touch the registry: the
    name for anything that speaks names (engine commands, events), the id for
    anything keyed by id (the session table, per-participant counters). *)
